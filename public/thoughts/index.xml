      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first two posts of &lt;em&gt;Spatium Novum&lt;/em&gt;, I began by asking what remains to explore when traditional frontiers—scientific, geographic, conceptual—seem mapped or saturated. That led naturally to a second question: how do we orient ourselves internally when the world no longer provides a clear external direction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I explored goal-making not as a matter of setting destinations, but as a recursive, uncertain process embedded in perception, identity, and context. But as I pushed deeper, a more foundational question emerged:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction-when-exploration-requires-a-destination&#34;&gt;Introduction: When Exploration Requires a Destination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I embraced the metaphor of exploration—not of lands or oceans, but of models, ideas, and intellectual frontiers. I wrote that the realm of thought still offers vast space to map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But exploration, even metaphorical, carries a hidden assumption: that we’re going &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maps, by definition, imply destinations. And destinations imply goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, already, is a curious twist. Before we talk about how to explore—or how to live meaningfully, or how to do science or build a life—we might ask a more basic question: &lt;strong&gt;how do we choose where we’re trying to go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-drive-to-explore&#34;&gt;The Drive to Explore&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilQOvPeI9T0&#34;&gt;young Truman&lt;/a&gt;, I, too, once felt a powerful desire echoing through me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I&amp;rsquo;d like to be an explorer, like the Great Magellan!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was filled with enthusiasm—convinced the world was still brimming with mysteries waiting to be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I grew older, I had to confront a more sobering thought: maybe I was born too late. Maybe, as Truman is told, &lt;em&gt;“there&amp;rsquo;s really nothing left to explore.”&lt;/em&gt;
The physical world—at least the surface of it—seemed mapped, measured, and monetized.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
